it's a funding arbitrage bot for mangomarkets

## Cool shit

check out the mango money multiplier except it's as a pool and you can stake lp tokens to get your proportional share of the fees from anyone buying into / selling out of pool :D

## To Repro


0. you must have a Solana private key in id.json in a few spots, and in ~/.config/solana/id.json. it's a mess, I know
1. replace meAndThePeeps with the publickeys of wallets you wish to trade (not Mango account pubkeys)
2. run sudo docker-compose up --build
3. voila


I went on an absolute hunch and got it working on devnet.2 :)

## Important

1. Risk only what you can afford to lose.
2. Trading at leverage is extremely risky, and there is a chance you may lose all your funds.
3. In no way do I or any other party imply let alone assure results.
4. Historical data is no indication of future activity.
5. This is extremely alpha software, largely undocumented and completely without tests or helpful comments. Use at your own risk.
6. Nothing I do or say should ever be misconstrued as financial advice.
